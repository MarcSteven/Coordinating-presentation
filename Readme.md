# Protocol Oriented Coordinators

These are the resulting playgrounds of my talk at [SwiftConf 2016](https://swiftconf.com) and [do iOS 2016](http://do-ios.com)

To play around with it, airdrop the `SwiftConf.playgroundbook` or `do iOS.playgroundbook` to you iPad running iOS 10 with Swift Playgrounds installed and it will automatically open.

Because Playground Books aren't compatible with the latest XCode, the files `SwiftConf XCode.playground` and `do iOS XCode.playground` contain an XCode compatible version of the playground to play around with the code on the Mac. Unfortunately `UIImagePickerController` isn't working in XCode, so you have to use the iOS version to get that to work.
