# Protocol Oriented Coordinators

These are the resulting playgrounds of my talk at [SwiftConf 2016](https://swiftconf.com)

To play around with it, airdrop the `SwiftConf.playgroundbook` to you iPad running iOS 10 beta 8 and it will automatically open in Swift Playgrounds.

Because Playground Books aren't compatible with the latest XCode Beta 6, the file `SwiftConf XCode.playground` contains an XCode compatible version of the playground to play around with the code on the Mac. Unfortunately `UIImagePickerController` isn't working in XCode, so you have to use the iOS version to get that to work.
